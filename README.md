# DoubleAttentionSpeakerVerification

Pytorch implemenation of the model proposed in the paper:

Double Multi-Head Attention for Speaker Verification
https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13199

Due to the rejection of this paper in Interspeech 2020, we are currently
working on improving the results so as to be closer to current SOTA.
Hence, it's possible that you find some methods or techniques not described
in the paper.

## Installation

This repository has been created using python3.6. You can find the python3
dependencies on requirements.txt. Hence you can install it by:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note that soundfile library also needs the C libsndfile library. You can find
more details about its installation in [Soundfile](https://pysoundfile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Usage

Will be updated soon.
